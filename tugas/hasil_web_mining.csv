This paper explores the prevalence of power-law distributions in large-scale graph structures and their implications for graph query analysis. We investigate techniques for efficiently mining graphs that exhibit power-law characteristics, leveraging these distributions to optimize query performance and scalability. Our study presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies for detecting power-law behavior in graphs, highlighting their impact on graph traversal, indexing, and query execution. We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the interplay between graph topology and query optimization, paving the way for enhanced graph mining frameworks. Our work contributes to the development of more scalable and intelligent graph query processing systems, with broad implications for data-driven decision-making.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93802-3_7

Each constituent system has its own purpose and could operate and collaborate voluntarily with other constituent systems to achieve a common goal that cannot be treated by any of them in isolation. Objective: A constituent system may be deployed or undeployed at run-time within an SoS. Emergent behaviors may be undesirable and affect the behaviors of each constituent system and lead to unexpected operations and a lack of permanent status in the SoS. Thus, we need to continuously extract and represent the actual behaviors within the SoS at run-time. Method: In this paper, we implement the first step our “Architecture Mining” approach. Thus, we monitor an SoS and develop Discovery algorithm to extract the actual behaviors. The actual behaviors are presented by a “Discovered Model” dynamically and automatically built from the execution traces. Results: To implement our approach, we applied it to a case study entitled Smart City, which is an SoS including six types of constituent systems. We extracted the actual behaviors executed at run time from the SoS execution traces, which have never been modeled in any constituent system nor expected by the designer.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-981-96-7238-7_2

These methods allow you to train the system based on historical data and identify hidden patterns that may not be obvious in traditional analysis. Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict breakdowns, optimize production processes and identify anomalies in the operation of machinery. For example, with the help of training on data on the operation of equipment, you can create a model that will predict the probability of failure of a certain part under specified operating conditions.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-95296-8_15
10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_6,‘Internet of Things’ and ‘Social Networking’: Containment,"Moving to the post-2000 period, or the post-formation Internet Polity, this chapter begins with the implications of the internet becoming the centred repository of sources, medium of investigation, and object in historicist accounts of recent and contemporary events. Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-90470-7_6
10.1007/978-3-031-93802-3_10,Integrating Graph Convolutional Networks for Web Traffic Prediction,"Web traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing network resources, enhancing user experience, and ensuring efficient server load management. Traditional approaches, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and machine learning methods like support vector machines and decision trees, focus primarily on temporal data. These models, however, often fail to capture the intricate relationships within web traffic data, such as user interactions or page-to-page connections, resulting in sub-optimal predictive performance. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) address these limitations by modeling web traffic as a graph, where web pages or users are represented as nodes, and their interactions form edges. GCNs aggregate node information through graph structures, enabling the model to learn both spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in web traffic. This ability to exploit complex data relationships makes GCNs well-suited for more accurate and dynamic web traffic predictions. In this work, we propose a GCN-based framework for web traffic forecasting, incorporating multiple optimizers like Adam, RMSProp, and SGD to identify the model’s fair performance. By optimizing training through these methods, the GCN model efficiently captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in web traffic patterns. Our study highlights the potential of GCNs in elevating the accuracy and reliability of web traffic forecasting. The integration of advanced optimizers further enhances convergence and prediction efficiency, offering a more scalable solution to meet the demands of rapidly growing and complex web systems.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93802-3_10
10.1007/978-3-032-00793-3_13,Predictive Analytics of Injection Attacks in Web Applications,"Cybersecurity threats such as SQL injection and Cross-site Scripting (XSS) are examples of injection attacks that pose a substantial risk to both individuals and organizations. Through the use of software application vulnerabilities, these assaults give malevolent actors the ability to enter systems without authorization, steal confidential information, or jeopardize system integrity. The ever-changing nature of injection threats makes traditional rule-based security methods ineffective. The suggested model concentrates on using machine learning approach to successfully detect these injection assaults in order to address this difficulty. The main goal of this research is to create a reliable solution for identifying injection attacks in databases and online applications. The system will continuously analyze application input by using supervised machine learning method (Multinominal Naïve Bayes). It is capable of identifying patterns linked to injection attacks, such as peculiar input patterns and unexpected actions. The website’s activity is monitored and a track of these instances is kept in a different database to help in detecting and preventing similar assaults. The necessary analysis is derived from this occurrence history. The use of this study can help in predicting and protecting the web applications from future possible attacks.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-00793-3_13
10.1007/978-3-031-93257-1_6,Adaptive Web API Recommendation via Matching Service Clusters and Mashup Requirement,"With the rapid proliferation of Web services and Web APIs, recommendation systems can effectively address the issue of information overload and alleviate the burden of meaningless filtering. Existing approaches can help filtering appropriate Web services for mashup creation, however, they often fall short of developers’ different and personalized needs by recommending only a fixed number of APIs and lack precision in aligning mashup requirements across all categories. To solve the above issue, this paper introduces a novel Web service recommendation framework called AWAR for mashup creation, which focuses on the matching strategy between mashup requirements and Web APIs, and enhances recommendation effectiveness by integrating natural language processing, optimization algorithms, and deep learning. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach receives superior recommendation results on multiple evaluation metrics compared to advanced competing baselines.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-031-93257-1_6
10.1007/978-3-032-02936-2_19,Multimodal Zero-Shot Activity Recognition for Process Mining of Robotic Systems,"Understanding and analyzing the behavior of robotic systems is essential to ensure their reliability, efficiency, and continuous improvement, especially as robots are increasingly deployed in complex, dynamic environments. Process mining offers a powerful approach to uncover and analyze the execution of robotic operations. However, applying process mining to robotic systems requires bridging the gap between fine-grained multimodal data and high-level activity representations. Recent advances in foundation models provide a promising solution to this challenge, as the knowledge acquired during their extensive pretraining enables them to interpret multimodal data without the need for task-specific training. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal process mining pipeline that leverages the zero-shot capabilities of foundation models to perform activity recognition from visual and auditory inputs. By transforming fine-grained multimodal data into event logs, the pipeline enables the application of process mining techniques to robotic systems. We applied our approach to the Baxter UR5 95 Objects dataset, which offers synchronized video and audio recordings of a Baxter robot manipulating objects. The fusion of activity recognition results from these complementary modalities yields an event log that more accurately represents the robot’s operations, mitigating imprecision associated with using a single modality. Our results demonstrate that foundation models effectively enable the application of process mining to robotic systems, facilitating monitoring and analysis of their behavior.",http://link.springer.com/openurl/fulltext?id=doi:10.1007/978-3-032-02936-2_19
