The academic outcomes can be predicted using features like the student records, attendance, socioeconomic status of the student, behaviour, etc.; by using supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forests in this method, the educators can predict the above-specified features in an efficient manner. This approach is to apply the models for early detection of such students so that we can help them before it is too late or offer them a learning plan that will suit them. The goal of this review is to identify the existing approaches of supervised learning algorithms for predicting students’ performance: to outline their advantages and disadvantages and the results achieved. The review mentions that despite the potential of the current models like Random Forests, SVM, and Logistic Regression, there is still the question about model interpretation, model scaling, and making them ‘real-time’. The next research endeavours will be able to close these gaps to the incorporation of deep learning models, explaining AI, and multi-modal data acquisition. Avatar-based technologies could enhance the precision and flexibility of the prediction models helping educators make better decisions.

While Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) is instrumental in diagnosing ischemic stroke, current practices primarily rely on the manual assessment of DWI images to delineate the ischemic core, a time-intensive and subjective process that introduces variability in clinical decisions regarding endovascular treatments.
