The academic outcomes can be predicted using features like the student records, attendance, socioeconomic status of the student, behaviour, etc.; by using supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forests in this method, the educators can predict the above-specified features in an efficient manner. This approach is to apply the models for early detection of such students so that we can help them before it is too late or offer them a learning plan that will suit them. The goal of this review is to identify the existing approaches of supervised learning algorithms for predicting studentsâ€™ performance: to outline their advantages and disadvantages and the results achieved.
