Title: Unveiling Power Laws in Graph Mining: Techniques and Applications in Graph Query Analysis
Abstract: Power laws play a crucial role in understanding the structural and functional properties of real-world graphs, influencing various aspects of graph mining and query processing. This paper explores the prevalence of power-law distributions in large-scale graph structures and their implications for graph query analysis. We investigate techniques for efficiently mining graphs that exhibit power-law characteristics, leveraging these distributions to optimize query performance and scalability. Our study presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies for detecting power-law behavior in graphs, highlighting their impact on graph traversal, indexing, and query execution. We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the interplay between graph topology and query optimization, paving the way for enhanced graph mining frameworks. Our work contributes to the development of more scalable and intelligent graph query processing systems, with broad implications for data-driven decision-making.

Title: Architecture Mining Approach for Systems-of-Systems: Monitoring and Discovery
Abstract: Context: Systems of Systems (SoS) constitute a type of complex software systems resulting from integrating heterogeneous constituent systems that are independently operable on their own but are networked together for a common goal. Each constituent system has its own purpose and could operate and collaborate voluntarily with other constituent systems to achieve a common goal that cannot be treated by any of them in isolation. Objective: A constituent system may be deployed or undeployed at run-time within an SoS. Emergent behaviors may be undesirable and affect the behaviors of each constituent system and lead to unexpected operations and a lack of permanent status in the SoS. Thus, we need to continuously extract and represent the actual behaviors within the SoS at run-time. Method: In this paper, we implement the first step our “Architecture Mining” approach. Thus, we monitor an SoS and develop Discovery algorithm to extract the actual behaviors. The actual behaviors are presented by a “Discovered Model” dynamically and automatically built from the execution traces. Results: To implement our approach, we applied it to a case study entitled Smart City, which is an SoS including six types of constituent systems. We extracted the actual behaviors executed at run time from the SoS execution traces, which have never been modeled in any constituent system nor expected by the designer.

Title: A Mathematical Model and Algorithm for Data Analysis in the Intelligent Management System for Mining and Transport Complexes
Abstract: Machine learning methods play an important role in creating algorithms for data analysis in the mining industry. These methods allow you to train the system based on historical data and identify hidden patterns that may not be obvious in traditional analysis. Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict breakdowns, optimize production processes and identify anomalies in the operation of machinery. For example, with the help of training on data on the operation of equipment, you can create a model that will predict the probability of failure of a certain part under specified operating conditions.

Title: ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘Social Networking’: Containment
Abstract: Moving to the post-2000 period, or the post-formation Internet Polity, this chapter begins with the implications of the internet becoming the centred repository of sources, medium of investigation, and object in historicist accounts of recent and contemporary events. Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations.

Title: Integrating Graph Convolutional Networks for Web Traffic Prediction
Abstract: Web traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing network resources, enhancing user experience, and ensuring efficient server load management. Traditional approaches, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and machine learning methods like support vector machines and decision trees, focus primarily on temporal data. These models, however, often fail to capture the intricate relationships within web traffic data, such as user interactions or page-to-page connections, resulting in sub-optimal predictive performance. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) address these limitations by modeling web traffic as a graph, where web pages or users are represented as nodes, and their interactions form edges. GCNs aggregate node information through graph structures, enabling the model to learn both spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in web traffic. This ability to exploit complex data relationships makes GCNs well-suited for more accurate and dynamic web traffic predictions. In this work, we propose a GCN-based framework for web traffic forecasting, incorporating multiple optimizers like Adam, RMSProp, and SGD to identify the model’s fair performance. By optimizing training through these methods, the GCN model efficiently captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in web traffic patterns. Our study highlights the potential of GCNs in elevating the accuracy and reliability of web traffic forecasting. The integration of advanced optimizers further enhances convergence and prediction efficiency, offering a more scalable solution to meet the demands of rapidly growing and complex web systems.

Title: Predictive Analytics of Injection Attacks in Web Applications
Abstract: Cybersecurity threats such as SQL injection and Cross-site Scripting (XSS) are examples of injection attacks that pose a substantial risk to both individuals and organizations. Through the use of software application vulnerabilities, these assaults give malevolent actors the ability to enter systems without authorization, steal confidential information, or jeopardize system integrity. The ever-changing nature of injection threats makes traditional rule-based security methods ineffective. The suggested model concentrates on using machine learning approach to successfully detect these injection assaults in order to address this difficulty. The main goal of this research is to create a reliable solution for identifying injection attacks in databases and online applications. The system will continuously analyze application input by using supervised machine learning method (Multinominal Naïve Bayes). It is capable of identifying patterns linked to injection attacks, such as peculiar input patterns and unexpected actions. The website’s activity is monitored and a track of these instances is kept in a different database to help in detecting and preventing similar assaults. The necessary analysis is derived from this occurrence history. The use of this study can help in predicting and protecting the web applications from future possible attacks.

Title: Adaptive Web API Recommendation via Matching Service Clusters and Mashup Requirement
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Web services and Web APIs, recommendation systems can effectively address the issue of information overload and alleviate the burden of meaningless filtering. Existing approaches can help filtering appropriate Web services for mashup creation, however, they often fall short of developers’ different and personalized needs by recommending only a fixed number of APIs and lack precision in aligning mashup requirements across all categories. To solve the above issue, this paper introduces a novel Web service recommendation framework called AWAR for mashup creation, which focuses on the matching strategy between mashup requirements and Web APIs, and enhances recommendation effectiveness by integrating natural language processing, optimization algorithms, and deep learning. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach receives superior recommendation results on multiple evaluation metrics compared to advanced competing baselines.

Title: Multimodal Zero-Shot Activity Recognition for Process Mining of Robotic Systems
Abstract: Understanding and analyzing the behavior of robotic systems is essential to ensure their reliability, efficiency, and continuous improvement, especially as robots are increasingly deployed in complex, dynamic environments. Process mining offers a powerful approach to uncover and analyze the execution of robotic operations. However, applying process mining to robotic systems requires bridging the gap between fine-grained multimodal data and high-level activity representations. Recent advances in foundation models provide a promising solution to this challenge, as the knowledge acquired during their extensive pretraining enables them to interpret multimodal data without the need for task-specific training. In this work, we propose a novel multimodal process mining pipeline that leverages the zero-shot capabilities of foundation models to perform activity recognition from visual and auditory inputs. By transforming fine-grained multimodal data into event logs, the pipeline enables the application of process mining techniques to robotic systems. We applied our approach to the Baxter UR5 95 Objects dataset, which offers synchronized video and audio recordings of a Baxter robot manipulating objects. The fusion of activity recognition results from these complementary modalities yields an event log that more accurately represents the robot’s operations, mitigating imprecision associated with using a single modality. Our results demonstrate that foundation models effectively enable the application of process mining to robotic systems, facilitating monitoring and analysis of their behavior.

Title: Leveraging Machine Learning Techniques for Customer Data Deduplication - Hard-Won Lessons from a Real-World Project in the Financial Industry
Abstract: This paper is associated with a tutorial presented at DEXA 2025 Conferences and Workshops. The tutorial shares the practical experience gained from a 3-year R&amp;D project for a big financial institution in Poland. The project aimed at developing deduplication pipelines for customer records. It involved the development of two distinct end-to-end deduplication pipelines that are based on (1) statistical/probabilistic modeling and on (2) machine learning. This tutorial focuses on lessons learned from developing the machine learning pipeline , within the context of a real-world industrial setting. Moreover, this tutorial provides an overview of approaches to data deduplication, including the traditional state-of-the-art baseline deduplication pipeline, solutions based on machine learning and neural networks that apply pre-trained and large language models.

Title: ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘Social Networking’: Containment
Abstract: Moving to the post-2000 period, or the post-formation Internet Polity, this chapter begins with the implications of the internet becoming the centred repository of sources, medium of investigation, and object in historicist accounts of recent and contemporary events. Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations.

Title: Unveiling Power Laws in Graph Mining: Techniques and Applications in Graph Query Analysis
Abstract: Power laws play a crucial role in understanding the structural and functional properties of real-world graphs, influencing various aspects of graph mining and query processing. This paper explores the prevalence of power-law distributions in large-scale graph structures and their implications for graph query analysis. We investigate techniques for efficiently mining graphs that exhibit power-law characteristics, leveraging these distributions to optimize query performance and scalability. Our study presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies for detecting power-law behavior in graphs, highlighting their impact on graph traversal, indexing, and query execution. We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the interplay between graph topology and query optimization, paving the way for enhanced graph mining frameworks. Our work contributes to the development of more scalable and intelligent graph query processing systems, with broad implications for data-driven decision-making.

Title: An Enhanced FP-Growth Algorithm with Hybrid Adaptive Support Threshold for Association Rule Mining
Abstract: Finding frequent itemsets remains challenging due to manual threshold specification requirements in existing algorithms. This paper presents an Enhanced FP-Growth algorithm incorporating a hybrid adaptive support threshold that combines statistical variance analysis, frequency distribution patterns, and transaction density metrics. The algorithm automatically adjusts support levels based on dataset characteristics, eliminating manual threshold tuning. Experimental evaluation on five benchmark datasets against Aprior, FP-growth, and FP-Max shows our Enhanced FP-Growth consistently achieves superior execution time and improved memory efficiency. The hybrid threshold mechanism dynamically calibrates according to dataset characteristics, offering substantial efficiency gains across diverse data types.

Title: An Empirical Analysis on the Use of Third-Party HTTP Clients in Open-Source Java Projects
Abstract: External communication libraries (e.g., for HTTP/REST) are static dependencies that enable dynamic dependencies in software systems. Such third-party HTTP libraries may influence the system’s qualities. Thus, the selection out of numerous third-party HTTP clients needs to be taken carefully. However, the use of such clients has not been studied broadly. We conduct a quantitative empirical study of 18,879 open-source Java repositories and analyze 259,683 configuration files. We further investigate a subset of these repositories qualitatively and in more depth. We have found that Apache HttpClient, Spring Web, and OkHttp are the most used third-party HTTP clients in Java open-source projects. Further analysis has shown that declared dependencies are often not actively managed, reference outdated versions, or are entirely unused.

Title: Adaptive Web API Recommendation via Matching Service Clusters and Mashup Requirement
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Web services and Web APIs, recommendation systems can effectively address the issue of information overload and alleviate the burden of meaningless filtering. Existing approaches can help filtering appropriate Web services for mashup creation, however, they often fall short of developers’ different and personalized needs by recommending only a fixed number of APIs and lack precision in aligning mashup requirements across all categories. To solve the above issue, this paper introduces a novel Web service recommendation framework called AWAR for mashup creation, which focuses on the matching strategy between mashup requirements and Web APIs, and enhances recommendation effectiveness by integrating natural language processing, optimization algorithms, and deep learning. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach receives superior recommendation results on multiple evaluation metrics compared to advanced competing baselines.

Title: Benchmarking Embedding Techniques for Modeling User Navigation Behavior on Task-Oriented Software
Abstract: Understanding user navigation patterns from clickstream data is crucial for improving business software, yet remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of real-world environments. Unlike controlled settings, real-world clickstreams are noisy, fragmented, and often incomplete, due to session timeouts, network issues, caching, or third-party interactions—making it difficult to reconstruct coherent user journeys. Additionally, the absence of labeled data hinders the use of supervised learning, pushing researchers toward unsupervised or heuristic-based approaches that struggle to fully capture user behavior. In this paper, we present a benchmark of embedding techniques for modeling user navigation behavior on task-oriented software. We identify distinct user behaviors across three real-world case studies. Results show that Pattern2Vec outperforms Word2Vec in capturing meaningful task-based navigation patterns, confirming its suitability for clickstream analysis.

Title: What Do We Know About Software Analytics Research? A Critical Review of Secondary Studies
Abstract: Software analytics (SA) is often proposed as a tool to support software engineering (SE) tasks. Several secondary studies on SA have been published, some published within the same calendar year. This presents an opportunity to take a meta-perspective and examine how the field of SA has been conceptualized and synthesized so far. By analyzing how SA is defined, which topics are emphasized, what search strategies are employed, and to what extent primary studies overlap, we aim to identify gaps, trends, and redundancies in the current body of secondary studies. Such insights can inform the design and focus of future secondary studies. We identified five secondary studies on SA published from 2015 to 2023 that cover primary research from 2000 to 2021. Despite similarities in objectives and overlapping search timeframes, the secondary studies have negligible overlap in their included primary studies. Each secondary study presents a distinct perspective, and collectively, the five secondary studies offer a fragmented rather than cohesive view of the research landscape. We present a structured overview of the identified secondary studies in terms of their objectives, research quality, and findings. This overview helps readers navigate and leverage existing research. The analysis also indicates that there is potential for further secondary research to build a more cohesive and comprehensive understanding of the SA literature.

Title: DevScholar: A Reuse-Based Approach for Evaluating Developer Contribution
Abstract: Evaluating each developer’s contributions within collaborative software projects is essential for effective resource allocation, recognition of expertise, and identifying training needs. Traditional metrics such as lines of code (LOCs) or the number of commits fail to provide a comprehensive context since code varies in importance and complexity. On the other hand, writing reusable code is an essential coding practice that can serve as a metric for measuring the quality of the developers’ contributions. Our goal is to develop a methodology and a practical tool for evaluating developers’ reusable code contributions within a software project. Drawing inspiration from Hirsch’s H-Index, a benchmark metric in academia, we constructed the Developer H-Index (DH-Index). It tracks each method’s usage throughout the project identified via call graphs akin to citations in academic research and links these references to the respective developer contributions. We also created a variation of the DH-Index that weighs method usage with the Lines-of-Code-Weighted Developer H-Index (LWDH-Index). We developed DevScholar, a publicly available prototype that extracts and analyzes method-based contributions from software developers of a Java project. We compared our tool’s capabilities with GitHub Insights on four Open Source Software (OSS) projects, Apollo, Spring Boot, Retrofit, and Dubbo but only presenting the results of Apollo project. LWDH-Index resulted in a stronger metric, as it smoothed out the effect of the disproportionate contribution of frequently called methods that are too simple and of rarely called methods that are too long. In conclusion, compared to simple metrics based only on LOC or the number of commits, the DH-Index and LWDH-Index offer additional perspectives for evaluating developers’ contributions to reusable code within a software project team.

Title: Analyzing Water Consumption Patterns in Mexico City: A GIS and Data Science Approach
Abstract: Water scarcity in Mexico City has become an increasingly urgent issue, exacerbated by inefficient and unequal consumption patterns across its urban fabric. This study advances Geographic Information Systems (GIS) research by developing and applying an integrative spatial analysis framework specifically tailored to the complexities of urban water management. Beyond its application to Mexico City, the research demonstrates how GIS can be used to fuse heterogeneous datasets, including those from SACMEX (Mexico City’s Water System), INEGI (National Institute of Statistics and Geography), and DENUE (National Directory of Economic Units), into a unified analytical environment. Through a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), spatial data mining, and clustering techniques, the study identifies critical disparities in water consumption at multiple spatial scales, from boroughs to neighborhoods. A key contribution is the implementation of a layered system architecture for managing historic spatiotemporal data, enabling dynamic visualization of consumption patterns. The findings reveal that socio-economic and demographic variables play a decisive role in shaping spatial water demand, with marginalized communities facing disproportionate challenges. While previous spatiotemporal analyses of water consumption in Mexico City have primarily focused on aggregated borough-level data or isolated socio-demographic correlations, they have often lacked multiscale integration, high-resolution neighborhood-level analysis, or interactive visualization tools to support policy development. This research addresses these limitations by providing a fine-grained, multilayered analytical approach that enhances the scientific understanding of urban water use. Beyond offering immediate policy-relevant insights for Mexico City, the methodological framework proposed here contributes to GIS research by providing a scalable, transferable approach for analyzing urban resource consumption patterns. Future work will focus on incorporating real-time data streams, expanding sector-specific analysis, and integrating additional variables and domains required for a comprehensive understanding of water dynamics. This study represents a first step toward building an adaptive, equitable, and efficient urban water management strategy.

Title: Integrative Review of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches for Cardiovascular Disease Detection, Classification, and Prediction
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the predominant cause of mortality globally, surpassing both diabetes and cancer. Reducing illness and mortality rates requires the prompt identification and accurate prediction of CVDs. Diagnostic techniques such as coronary angiography are very precise but also invasive, costly, and cause discomfort. There is a need for diagnostic approaches that are reliable and do not require intrusive procedures. Machine learning (ML) and data mining play a crucial role in healthcare, particularly in the identification of heart problems. ML algorithms can accurately predict cardiac disease by analyzing clinical data, aiding in clinical decision-making. This comprehensive study provides a concise overview of the latest developments in ML and DL techniques for the detection, classification, and prediction of CVDs. The assessment assesses Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Artificial Neural Networks, Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Decision Trees. The evaluation is based on data from trustworthy sources spanning from 2014 to 2024. The report additionally delineates the main obstacles encountered by researchers, examines potential remedies, and proposes future investigations to augment heart disease prediction systems. This study assesses the efficacy of clinical decision-making tools in enhancing the identification and prevention of CVD.

Title: An Extensive Investigation of Supervised Machine Learning (SML) Procedures Aimed at Learners’ Performance Forecast with Learning Analytics
Abstract: Techniques such as machine learning for performance prediction in a group of students have become a vital aid in current education. The academic outcomes can be predicted using features like the student records, attendance, socioeconomic status of the student, behaviour, etc.; by using supervised learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forests in this method, the educators can predict the above-specified features in an efficient manner. This approach is to apply the models for early detection of such students so that we can help them before it is too late or offer them a learning plan that will suit them. The goal of this review is to identify the existing approaches of supervised learning algorithms for predicting students’ performance: to outline their advantages and disadvantages and the results achieved. The review mentions that despite the potential of the current models like Random Forests, SVM, and Logistic Regression, there is still the question about model interpretation, model scaling, and making them ‘real-time’. The next research endeavours will be able to close these gaps to the incorporation of deep learning models, explaining AI, and multi-modal data acquisition. Avatar-based technologies could enhance the precision and flexibility of the prediction models helping educators make better decisions. However, data privacy and fairness issues will also need to be tackled in order to promote the right use of the technologies. In conclusion, there is apparently a lot of potential for machine learning in education that will lead to the best of learner outcomes.

Title: Artificial Intelligence for Predicting Acute Ischemic Stroke Outcomes: Current Practices and Future Directions
Abstract: Acute ischemic stroke is a critical medical emergency caused by a sudden loss of blood flow to the brain, leading to brain cell death due to a lack of oxygen and nutrients. While Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) is instrumental in diagnosing ischemic stroke, current practices primarily rely on the manual assessment of DWI images to delineate the ischemic core, a time-intensive and subjective process that introduces variability in clinical decisions regarding endovascular treatments. This study aims to address these limitations by evaluating artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for automated DWI analysis, focusing on their potential to enhance stroke outcome prediction accuracy and consistency. Using a systematic review methodology, we examine AI applications that automatically identify stroke-affected areas in DWI scans and compare key approaches in terms of their performance metrics. Our findings indicate that AI methodologies can improve the speed and precision of stroke assessments, suggesting that these technologies have significant implications for advancing diagnostic consistency and aiding clinical decision-making in stroke care.
