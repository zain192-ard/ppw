Title: Exploring Multimodal Framework of Optimized Feature-Based Machine Learning to Revolutionize the Diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease: AI-Driven Insights
Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, poses significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide due to its increasing prevalence and need for early detection to improve patient outcomes. This study introduces a robust diagnostic framework leveraging a multimodal feature selection approach, combining Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), to optimize predictive accuracy in detecting PD. Using a dataset of 894 instances from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the framework implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and feature selection techniques to refine input features. The Extra Trees classifier, integrated with the mRMR-RFE multimodal feature selection method, demonstrated superior performance over nine other machine learning models, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100%, with high specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. This framework highlights the efficacy of ensemble learning methods and feature optimization in healthcare, ensuring computational efficiency and high predictive reliability. By addressing the challenges of dimensionality reduction and ensuring precise predictions, the proposed model sets a benchmark for machine learning applications in PD diagnosis. The results emphasize the potential of this framework to facilitate early detection and support clinical decision making, with significant implications for advancing AI-driven healthcare systems.

Title: Development of Toughened Poly (lactic acid) by Melt Blending with Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) Using Epoxidized Castor Oil as a Compatibilizer for Biomedical Applications
Abstract: Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is a bioderived and biodegradable thermoplastic widely used in various applications; however, its brittleness limits its mechanical performance. To address this issue, this study develops fully biodegradable PLA/Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends compatibilized with epoxidized castor oil (ECO), providing a sustainable alternative to conventional non-biodegradable compatibilizers. PLA/PBAT blends with varying ECO concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) were prepared via melt mixing and characterized using multiple techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed effective interactions between ECO, PLA, and PBAT, enhancing compatibility. Thermal properties were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while contact angle measurements demonstrated an increase in hydrophilicity, confirming their suitability for biomedical applications. Mechanical testing revealed that PLA/PBAT blends with 1.0% ECO exhibited significantly improved elongation at break and impact strength without compromising tensile strength. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed uniform PBAT dispersion and enhanced interfacial morphology. Furthermore, cell proliferation, adhesion activity, and hemocompatibility assessments confirmed excellent biocompatibility, highlighting their potential for biomedical use. These findings suggest that ECO-modified PLA/PBAT blends offer a promising route for developing high-performance, biodegradable materials suitable for biomedical applications.

Title: Unveiling Power Laws in Graph Mining: Techniques and Applications in Graph Query Analysis
Abstract: Power laws play a crucial role in understanding the structural and functional properties of real-world graphs, influencing various aspects of graph mining and query processing. This paper explores the prevalence of power-law distributions in large-scale graph structures and their implications for graph query analysis. We investigate techniques for efficiently mining graphs that exhibit power-law characteristics, leveraging these distributions to optimize query performance and scalability. Our study presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies for detecting power-law behavior in graphs, highlighting their impact on graph traversal, indexing, and query execution. We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the interplay between graph topology and query optimization, paving the way for enhanced graph mining frameworks. Our work contributes to the development of more scalable and intelligent graph query processing systems, with broad implications for data-driven decision-making.

Title: Architecture Mining Approach for Systems-of-Systems: Monitoring and Discovery
Abstract: Context: Systems of Systems (SoS) constitute a type of complex software systems resulting from integrating heterogeneous constituent systems that are independently operable on their own but are networked together for a common goal. Each constituent system has its own purpose and could operate and collaborate voluntarily with other constituent systems to achieve a common goal that cannot be treated by any of them in isolation. Objective: A constituent system may be deployed or undeployed at run-time within an SoS. Emergent behaviors may be undesirable and affect the behaviors of each constituent system and lead to unexpected operations and a lack of permanent status in the SoS. Thus, we need to continuously extract and represent the actual behaviors within the SoS at run-time. Method: In this paper, we implement the first step our “Architecture Mining” approach. Thus, we monitor an SoS and develop Discovery algorithm to extract the actual behaviors. The actual behaviors are presented by a “Discovered Model” dynamically and automatically built from the execution traces. Results: To implement our approach, we applied it to a case study entitled Smart City, which is an SoS including six types of constituent systems. We extracted the actual behaviors executed at run time from the SoS execution traces, which have never been modeled in any constituent system nor expected by the designer.

Title: A Mathematical Model and Algorithm for Data Analysis in the Intelligent Management System for Mining and Transport Complexes
Abstract: Machine learning methods play an important role in creating algorithms for data analysis in the mining industry. These methods allow you to train the system based on historical data and identify hidden patterns that may not be obvious in traditional analysis. Machine learning algorithms can be used to predict breakdowns, optimize production processes and identify anomalies in the operation of machinery. For example, with the help of training on data on the operation of equipment, you can create a model that will predict the probability of failure of a certain part under specified operating conditions.

Title: ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘Social Networking’: Containment
Abstract: Moving to the post-2000 period, or the post-formation Internet Polity, this chapter begins with the implications of the internet becoming the centred repository of sources, medium of investigation, and object in historicist accounts of recent and contemporary events. Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations.

Title: Integrating Graph Convolutional Networks for Web Traffic Prediction
Abstract: Web traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in optimizing network resources, enhancing user experience, and ensuring efficient server load management. Traditional approaches, such as ARIMA, SARIMA, and machine learning methods like support vector machines and decision trees, focus primarily on temporal data. These models, however, often fail to capture the intricate relationships within web traffic data, such as user interactions or page-to-page connections, resulting in sub-optimal predictive performance. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) address these limitations by modeling web traffic as a graph, where web pages or users are represented as nodes, and their interactions form edges. GCNs aggregate node information through graph structures, enabling the model to learn both spatial and temporal dependencies inherent in web traffic. This ability to exploit complex data relationships makes GCNs well-suited for more accurate and dynamic web traffic predictions. In this work, we propose a GCN-based framework for web traffic forecasting, incorporating multiple optimizers like Adam, RMSProp, and SGD to identify the model’s fair performance. By optimizing training through these methods, the GCN model efficiently captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends in web traffic patterns. Our study highlights the potential of GCNs in elevating the accuracy and reliability of web traffic forecasting. The integration of advanced optimizers further enhances convergence and prediction efficiency, offering a more scalable solution to meet the demands of rapidly growing and complex web systems.

Title: Predictive Analytics of Injection Attacks in Web Applications
Abstract: Cybersecurity threats such as SQL injection and Cross-site Scripting (XSS) are examples of injection attacks that pose a substantial risk to both individuals and organizations. Through the use of software application vulnerabilities, these assaults give malevolent actors the ability to enter systems without authorization, steal confidential information, or jeopardize system integrity. The ever-changing nature of injection threats makes traditional rule-based security methods ineffective. The suggested model concentrates on using machine learning approach to successfully detect these injection assaults in order to address this difficulty. The main goal of this research is to create a reliable solution for identifying injection attacks in databases and online applications. The system will continuously analyze application input by using supervised machine learning method (Multinominal Naïve Bayes). It is capable of identifying patterns linked to injection attacks, such as peculiar input patterns and unexpected actions. The website’s activity is monitored and a track of these instances is kept in a different database to help in detecting and preventing similar assaults. The necessary analysis is derived from this occurrence history. The use of this study can help in predicting and protecting the web applications from future possible attacks.

Title: Adaptive Web API Recommendation via Matching Service Clusters and Mashup Requirement
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Web services and Web APIs, recommendation systems can effectively address the issue of information overload and alleviate the burden of meaningless filtering. Existing approaches can help filtering appropriate Web services for mashup creation, however, they often fall short of developers’ different and personalized needs by recommending only a fixed number of APIs and lack precision in aligning mashup requirements across all categories. To solve the above issue, this paper introduces a novel Web service recommendation framework called AWAR for mashup creation, which focuses on the matching strategy between mashup requirements and Web APIs, and enhances recommendation effectiveness by integrating natural language processing, optimization algorithms, and deep learning. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach receives superior recommendation results on multiple evaluation metrics compared to advanced competing baselines.

Title: Exploring Multimodal Framework of Optimized Feature-Based Machine Learning to Revolutionize the Diagnosis of Parkinson’s Disease: AI-Driven Insights
Abstract: Parkinson’s disease (PD), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, poses significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide due to its increasing prevalence and need for early detection to improve patient outcomes. This study introduces a robust diagnostic framework leveraging a multimodal feature selection approach, combining Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) with Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), to optimize predictive accuracy in detecting PD. Using a dataset of 894 instances from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the framework implemented comprehensive data preprocessing and feature selection techniques to refine input features. The Extra Trees classifier, integrated with the mRMR-RFE multimodal feature selection method, demonstrated superior performance over nine other machine learning models, achieving a perfect accuracy of 100%, with high specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F1 scores. This framework highlights the efficacy of ensemble learning methods and feature optimization in healthcare, ensuring computational efficiency and high predictive reliability. By addressing the challenges of dimensionality reduction and ensuring precise predictions, the proposed model sets a benchmark for machine learning applications in PD diagnosis. The results emphasize the potential of this framework to facilitate early detection and support clinical decision making, with significant implications for advancing AI-driven healthcare systems.

Title: Development of Toughened Poly (lactic acid) by Melt Blending with Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) Using Epoxidized Castor Oil as a Compatibilizer for Biomedical Applications
Abstract: Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is a bioderived and biodegradable thermoplastic widely used in various applications; however, its brittleness limits its mechanical performance. To address this issue, this study develops fully biodegradable PLA/Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) blends compatibilized with epoxidized castor oil (ECO), providing a sustainable alternative to conventional non-biodegradable compatibilizers. PLA/PBAT blends with varying ECO concentrations (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5%) were prepared via melt mixing and characterized using multiple techniques. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy confirmed effective interactions between ECO, PLA, and PBAT, enhancing compatibility. Thermal properties were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), while contact angle measurements demonstrated an increase in hydrophilicity, confirming their suitability for biomedical applications. Mechanical testing revealed that PLA/PBAT blends with 1.0% ECO exhibited significantly improved elongation at break and impact strength without compromising tensile strength. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed uniform PBAT dispersion and enhanced interfacial morphology. Furthermore, cell proliferation, adhesion activity, and hemocompatibility assessments confirmed excellent biocompatibility, highlighting their potential for biomedical use. These findings suggest that ECO-modified PLA/PBAT blends offer a promising route for developing high-performance, biodegradable materials suitable for biomedical applications.

Title: ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘Social Networking’: Containment
Abstract: Moving to the post-2000 period, or the post-formation Internet Polity, this chapter begins with the implications of the internet becoming the centred repository of sources, medium of investigation, and object in historicist accounts of recent and contemporary events. Debates on ‘technological determinism Technological determinism ’ are considered here. As events, 9/11 and the 2000 dot-com crash are pegged as turning points. A broad argument is proposed about the condition of the Internet Polity thereafter. It is suggested that it became contained in two moves during the 2000s. This containment involved, first, a space of the internet opening beyond the scope of the Internet Polity. This space incorporated data exchanges between ‘smart’ objects, unsupervised systems, and machine-learning systems. Second, much of the Internet Polity discourse and collective life became concentrated in very large platforms, which have global reach, local penetration, and data-management standards. This move facilitated the burgeoning data market and fed into the first move. The two moves are outlined by focusing on two catchwords and related terms. The first is addressed via the connotations of ‘Internet of Things’ and ‘smart’ objects, and the second by pausing on ‘social networking’ (on ‘sites’ or ‘platforms’). This chapter, and the study, concludes by briefly reconsidering the formative first principles of the Internet Polity, and pinpointing areas for further investigations.

Title: Unveiling Power Laws in Graph Mining: Techniques and Applications in Graph Query Analysis
Abstract: Power laws play a crucial role in understanding the structural and functional properties of real-world graphs, influencing various aspects of graph mining and query processing. This paper explores the prevalence of power-law distributions in large-scale graph structures and their implications for graph query analysis. We investigate techniques for efficiently mining graphs that exhibit power-law characteristics, leveraging these distributions to optimize query performance and scalability. Our study presents a comprehensive review of existing methodologies for detecting power-law behavior in graphs, highlighting their impact on graph traversal, indexing, and query execution. We also examine algorithmic optimizations tailored for power-law graphs, including degree-based indexing, community-aware search techniques, and efficient subgraph matching approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the applications of power-law principles in diverse domains such as social network analysis, bioinformatics, and knowledge graphs. Through empirical analysis on real-world datasets, we demonstrate how power-law-aware techniques improve query efficiency and reduce computational complexity in large graph databases. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the interplay between graph topology and query optimization, paving the way for enhanced graph mining frameworks. Our work contributes to the development of more scalable and intelligent graph query processing systems, with broad implications for data-driven decision-making.

Title: An Enhanced FP-Growth Algorithm with Hybrid Adaptive Support Threshold for Association Rule Mining
Abstract: Finding frequent itemsets remains challenging due to manual threshold specification requirements in existing algorithms. This paper presents an Enhanced FP-Growth algorithm incorporating a hybrid adaptive support threshold that combines statistical variance analysis, frequency distribution patterns, and transaction density metrics. The algorithm automatically adjusts support levels based on dataset characteristics, eliminating manual threshold tuning. Experimental evaluation on five benchmark datasets against Aprior, FP-growth, and FP-Max shows our Enhanced FP-Growth consistently achieves superior execution time and improved memory efficiency. The hybrid threshold mechanism dynamically calibrates according to dataset characteristics, offering substantial efficiency gains across diverse data types.

Title: An Empirical Analysis on the Use of Third-Party HTTP Clients in Open-Source Java Projects
Abstract: External communication libraries (e.g., for HTTP/REST) are static dependencies that enable dynamic dependencies in software systems. Such third-party HTTP libraries may influence the system’s qualities. Thus, the selection out of numerous third-party HTTP clients needs to be taken carefully. However, the use of such clients has not been studied broadly. We conduct a quantitative empirical study of 18,879 open-source Java repositories and analyze 259,683 configuration files. We further investigate a subset of these repositories qualitatively and in more depth. We have found that Apache HttpClient, Spring Web, and OkHttp are the most used third-party HTTP clients in Java open-source projects. Further analysis has shown that declared dependencies are often not actively managed, reference outdated versions, or are entirely unused.

Title: Adaptive Web API Recommendation via Matching Service Clusters and Mashup Requirement
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of Web services and Web APIs, recommendation systems can effectively address the issue of information overload and alleviate the burden of meaningless filtering. Existing approaches can help filtering appropriate Web services for mashup creation, however, they often fall short of developers’ different and personalized needs by recommending only a fixed number of APIs and lack precision in aligning mashup requirements across all categories. To solve the above issue, this paper introduces a novel Web service recommendation framework called AWAR for mashup creation, which focuses on the matching strategy between mashup requirements and Web APIs, and enhances recommendation effectiveness by integrating natural language processing, optimization algorithms, and deep learning. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach receives superior recommendation results on multiple evaluation metrics compared to advanced competing baselines.

Title: Benchmarking Embedding Techniques for Modeling User Navigation Behavior on Task-Oriented Software
Abstract: Understanding user navigation patterns from clickstream data is crucial for improving business software, yet remains challenging due to the complexity and variability of real-world environments. Unlike controlled settings, real-world clickstreams are noisy, fragmented, and often incomplete, due to session timeouts, network issues, caching, or third-party interactions—making it difficult to reconstruct coherent user journeys. Additionally, the absence of labeled data hinders the use of supervised learning, pushing researchers toward unsupervised or heuristic-based approaches that struggle to fully capture user behavior. In this paper, we present a benchmark of embedding techniques for modeling user navigation behavior on task-oriented software. We identify distinct user behaviors across three real-world case studies. Results show that Pattern2Vec outperforms Word2Vec in capturing meaningful task-based navigation patterns, confirming its suitability for clickstream analysis.

Title: What Do We Know About Software Analytics Research? A Critical Review of Secondary Studies
Abstract: Software analytics (SA) is often proposed as a tool to support software engineering (SE) tasks. Several secondary studies on SA have been published, some published within the same calendar year. This presents an opportunity to take a meta-perspective and examine how the field of SA has been conceptualized and synthesized so far. By analyzing how SA is defined, which topics are emphasized, what search strategies are employed, and to what extent primary studies overlap, we aim to identify gaps, trends, and redundancies in the current body of secondary studies. Such insights can inform the design and focus of future secondary studies. We identified five secondary studies on SA published from 2015 to 2023 that cover primary research from 2000 to 2021. Despite similarities in objectives and overlapping search timeframes, the secondary studies have negligible overlap in their included primary studies. Each secondary study presents a distinct perspective, and collectively, the five secondary studies offer a fragmented rather than cohesive view of the research landscape. We present a structured overview of the identified secondary studies in terms of their objectives, research quality, and findings. This overview helps readers navigate and leverage existing research. The analysis also indicates that there is potential for further secondary research to build a more cohesive and comprehensive understanding of the SA literature.

Title: Prediction of Diabetes Using Smart Decision Support System Based on Hybrid Fossa Green Anaconda Enabled Deep Learning Approach
Abstract: Diabetes is a major chronic disease categorized by elevating the range of sugar levels in blood cells, and early detection is crucial in reducing the risks and severity associated with the condition. Various machine learning (ML) schemes are developed to forecast the likelihood of an individual having diabetes. Classical systems lacked a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) using Deep Learning (DL) to predict varying diabetes levels and support clinical decisions. Therefore, a novel hybrid optimization technique Fossa Green Anaconda Optimization_Deep Kronecker Network (FGAO_DKN) is proposed for the efficient prediction of diabetes. FGAO_DKN is the amalgamation of Fossa Optimization Algorithm (FOA) and Green Anaconda Optimization (GAO) for improved feature selection and model training. The data are initially transformed using the Yeo–Johnson method. Afterward, feature selection is conducted by means of Fossa Green Anaconda Optimization (FGAO). Thereafter, data augmentation is performed with a Bootstrapping scheme. Finally, diabetes prediction is attained based on the Deep Kronecker Network (DKN). Moreover, DKN is trained with FGAO. The findings from the evaluation demonstrate that the FGAO_DKN attained an increased level of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity as 98.29%, 96.39%, and 98.59%, respectively. Thus, FGAO_DKN method offers a promising tool for healthcare professionals to make better decisions, certainly reducing the risks and severity of diabetes through timely intervention.

Title: Bone Osteoporosis Fractures Detection with Deep Learning: An X-ray Image Analysis Approach
Abstract: This research aims to develop a CNN-based computational framework for diagnosing bone fractures from X-rays, improving osteoporosis knowledge. Current osteoporosis management focuses on elderly fracture prevention, but many are unaware of their condition until a fracture occurs. This framework seeks to enable earlier diagnosis and management for all individuals, preventing fractures and improving quality of life, especially for at-risk and aging populations. These interesting findings prove modern deep learning systems as potential diagnoses for bone fractures even in cases of ones suffering from osteoporosis. This paper examines the use of DEXA radiography augmented by deep learning algorithms to estimate fracture risk beyond mineral density determination. The existence of computer-aided designs in numerous areas cuts across and helps to address the issues that are presented with the current methods of diagnosis. In the field of bone radiography, X-ray has been opted for in this study since it is more effective than CT scans. In this research, an advanced CNN model was applied that included a mix of architectural modifications to classical models and data augmentation techniques to outperform other standard CNN-based models. The Canny edge detection algorithm and the contour detection algorithm, both based on OpenCV, were incorporated and supplemented using Adam optimization. The focus of this work has been the enhancement of CNN model to detect fractures and localize it at the same time. The best model solely attained an accuracy level of 98.23%, outperforming all other tested models, including VGG16, VGG19, Random Forest Classifier, ViT’s, and its various versions.

Title: Python and Photoplethysmogram-Based Signal Processing Technique for Heart Rate Estimation, HRV Analysis and Other Relevant Processing of ECG and PPG Signals
Abstract: The Photoplethysmogram (PPG) is commonly used to determine Heart Rate (HR) and analyze Heart Rate Variability (HRV). It has been widely used in recent research to detect many psychological and physical problems. More new and advanced programming-based signal processing techniques are needed to be developed to analyze PPG signals more precisely and with added advanced features. This paper presented Python and pulse sensor-based, a low-cost technique for PPG signal analysis. In the PPG signals, the peaks were detected using the Peakutils library. The time differences of consecutive peaks were estimated to estimate the HR and analyze the HRV. The HR was estimated using three different methods. Peakutils library has successfully detected the peaks in the signals. The results obtained by the three methods were almost the same. The HRV was analyzed very comfortably in two different terms. Signal processing has been given a lot of focus in this technique, and it has produced good results. It will help in developing new devices (including IoT-based) and other advanced research on signal analysis, such as advanced investigation of P, Q, R, S, and T waves in the ECG signals and analysis of HRV of psychological and cardiac problematic patients.

Title: An Ensemble Learning Approach Using Deep Learning Models For Diabetic Retinopathy Severity Classification
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy most common preventable cause of vision impairment primarily affects people in their working years worldwide. The need for more accessible and effective methods of identifying managing diagnosing and treating retinal disorders has been brought to light by recent research. When designing a computer-aided diagnosis tool for diabetic retinopathy, it is crucial to evaluate both challenges of achieving a reliable early diagnosis at an affordable cost and effectiveness of screening programs. Biomedical engineers and computer scientists now have innovative ways to meet the demands of clinical practice thanks to developments in machine learning and deep learning techniques. The primary objective of this study is to develop a methodology for classifying the severity of diabetic retinopathy that integrates pre-processing, segmentation, and severity classification. For pre-processing, it is recommended to use median filtering, followed by segmentation with Gradient Descent—Sea Turtle Foraging Algorithm-based SwinUNet (GD-STFA-based SwinUNet). The diabetic retinopathy severity is then classified through the proposed ensemble learning using Xception,MoNet andPolyNet. Diabetic retinopathy cases are thus classified into five severity levels by proposed ensemble learning: No Diabetic Retinopathy, Mild Diabetic Retinopathy, Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy, Severe Diabetic Retinopathyand Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy. Experimental outcomes are compared with standard models and the proposed ensemble learning (MoNetPolyNetXception) technique outperforms them with 98.9% accuracy, 99% sensitivity, 98.5% specificity, and 98.4% precision rate.

Title: Improving Lung Cancer Diagnosis Using the Distributed Zero Attention Enabled Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network
Abstract: Respiratory cancer, the second prevalent contributor to cancer-related fatalities, necessitates timely diagnosis for improved patient outcomes. Nevertheless, there are drawbacks to the current approaches, such as computational complexity, limited robustness, data loss, and problems with data availability. To mitigate the drawbacks of the previous approaches, this research presents the Distributed Attention-Based Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (DisAPCN) model to achieve effective lung cancer detection. The proposed approach incorporates the Zero attention-based U-Net (ZU-Net) for segmenting the affected regions of the lungs. The ZU-Net effectively upgrades the ability of the model to attain precision outcomes with the reduction of numerous parameters that lead to minimizing the resources and time. Further, the deepened network of DisAPCN enables the model to diminish its computation at each layer and its size results in a pyramidical shape. Specifically, the DisAPCN model effectively captures the features of varied scales with progressive downsampling which enhances the training capability. Furthermore, the edge features along with the pre-trained models mitigate the vanishing gradient problems as well as enhance the framework’s detection performance. The evaluation findings reveal the dominance of DisAPCN model methods achieving a 95.52% F1 score, 95.40% precision, and 95.64% recall which is improved over the other traditional methods.

Title: Cloud IoMT-Enabled Brain Tumor Detection Using Optimized Dilated Residual Attention Network
Abstract: Brain tumor detection using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is vital for early diagnosis, but conventional methods often struggle with accuracy and real-time performance. This work introduces a novel cloud-supported Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) framework for efficient brain tumor classification. The proposed model, named Zeiler–Fergus Memory-Boosted Dilated Progressive Feedback Residual Attention Network with Dung Beetle Optimizer (ZFMBDPFRANet-DBO) integrates a Memory-Boosted Twin Guidance Filtering (MBTGF) mechanism to enhance MRI quality, followed by feature extraction using a Zeiler and Fergus Residual Network (ZFNet-DRN). A Dilated Progressive Feedback Residual Attention Network (DCPFRANet) is employed for classification, and optimization is carried out using the Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO). Testing out BraTS 2020 data set has an exceptional result of accuracy: 99.97% on normal, 99.84 percent on glioma, 99.60 percent on pituitary, and 99.87% on meningioma. The sensitivity and specificity are above 99%, the system has minimal delay (10.34 ms) and high throughput (1250 kbps), which is a key feature applicable in remote e-health cases. This architecture provides a scalable, performance-oriented framework to permit real-time diagnosis of brain tumor in healthcare systems equipped with IoMT.
